# Ugly as Sin

Ugly as Sin is a a mod for [Hideous Destructor](https://github.com/MatthewTheGlutton/HideousDestructor), adding various optional features and mechanics. Originally started as HD-Scavenger with a focus on longer-term "survival" features, but rapidly expanded into a general purpose enhancement mutator.

Features are implemented as configurable modules, any of which may be independently enabled or disabled as desired. The following modules are available:

* **Hunger** - Requires the player to eat and drink or suffer fatigue penalties.
* **Scarcity** - Reduce the supplies available to the player by despawning and/or breaking up ammo and item spawns.
* **Weapon Sling** - Allows the player to "brace" their weapon anywhere, even while standing.
* **Fragshard Reducer** - Specifies chance for enemy-reviving fragshards to spawn.
* **Friendly Marines** - Friendly marine reinforcements that randomly replace human-type corpses.
* **Advanced AI** - Extra monster behaviors, such as searching, wounding, and flashlights/lasers.
* **Looting** - Human-type corpses can be searched for useful items.
