# Second Flesh Cartridges

* **Classname:** `UaS_2FCartridge`
* **Loadout Code:** `2fm`

Autosuture treatment guns now have removable cartridges. Each cartridge contains one full dose of Second Flesh™ inert proprietart biofoam mixure (subdivided into seven partial doses) and and standard medical-grade hypoallergenic corrosion-resistant steel staples.

A stapler may contain up to six full modules. Once the first cartridge is unsealed, it is permanently locked in place, then is automatically ejected once empty before loading the next cartridge. This makes it quite easy to strip and refill Auto-Suture applicators while maintaining sterile conditions for each cartridgeand avoiding wasteful leakage.

Unfortuntely due to legal agreements, the Second Flesh™ formulation requires an approved applicator to properly activate the proprietary mixture. That said, the foam itself is suitable for bio-compatible tissue scaffolding and the staples are compatible with most handheld manual applicators.

## Controls

With the medikit stapler selected:

* Press `Unload` to remove one full module from the stapler.
* Press `Alt-Reload` to insert one full module into the stapler.
